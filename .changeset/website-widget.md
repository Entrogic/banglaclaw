Website widget: add `<script src="https://<gateway>/widget.js" async></script>` to any site listed in `channels.widget.allowedOrigins` for a chat bubble that anonymous visitors can use without an API key (signed visitor tokens, CSP frame-ancestors, per-visitor and per-IP limits, live operator replies during a handoff). Set `BANGLACLAW_WIDGET_SECRET` so visitors keep their conversation across restarts.
